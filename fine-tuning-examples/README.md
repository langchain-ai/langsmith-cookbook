# Exporting data for fine-tuning

The [LangSmith docs](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/tracing/use-cases/export-runs/local) contains examples of ways to filter and query the runs database for downstream tasks. The examples below share recipes on how to then use that data for fine-tuning.
- The [OpenAI Fine-Tuning](./export-to-openai/fine-tuning-on-chat-runs.ipynb) recipe shows a fast, simple way to list LLM runs in a project and convert them to OpenAI's fine-tuning format.
