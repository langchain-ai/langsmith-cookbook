# Fine-tuning

Fine-tune an LLM on collected run data using these recipes:

- [OpenAI Fine-Tuning](./export-to-openai/fine-tuning-on-chat-runs.ipynb): list LLM runs and convert them to OpenAI's fine-tuning format efficiently.
- [Lilac Dataset Curation](./lilac/lilac.ipynb): further curate your LangSmith datasets using Lilac to detect near-duplicates, check for PII, and more.
