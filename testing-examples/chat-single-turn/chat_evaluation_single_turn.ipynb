    "# Evaluate a Conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "[![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langsmith-cookbook/blob/main/testing-examples/chat-single-turn/chat_evaluation_single_turn.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat bots, designed to assist users or provide entertainment, typically engage in multiple conversational turns in any given chat session. Over extended interactions, there is potential for the quality of the LLM responses to diminish. This can manifest as difficulty in recalling earlier conversation details, improper interaction with external resources (if available), or repetitive and uninspired responses. If your current offline evaluations focus solely on individual question-answer pairs, such nuances may go unnoticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough guides you in creating a dataset to evaluate chatbots within multi-turn conversations. Rather than complicate the evaluation with simulation-based methods, the technique outlined below simplifies the process: we treat each data point as an individual dialogue turn. The image below shows two rows from the example dataset used in this walkthrough. The user's question would be difficult to comprehend when taken out of context, but the chat history provides enough information to cue the bot in on what should be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Simple dialogue examples](./img/comparison_screenshot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating each dialogue turn independently provides an additional benefit: if the examples are sampled from different stages of actual dialogues, they effectively capture and represent typical scenarios your bot should be able to handle well. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a concise overview of the process. Let's get started!"
