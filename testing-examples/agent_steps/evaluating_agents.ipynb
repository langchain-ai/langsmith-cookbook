        "# Evaluating Agents' Intermediate Steps\n",
        "[![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langsmith-cookbook/blob/main/testing-examples/agent_steps/evaluating_agents.ipynb)\n",

        "In many scenarios, evaluating an agent isn't merely about the final outcome, but about understanding the steps it took to arrive at that decision. This notebook provides an introductory walkthrough on configuring an evaluator to assess an agent based on its \"decision-making process,\" scoring based on the sequence of selected tools. \n",

        "We'll [create a custom run evaluator](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/faq/custom-evaluators#custom-evaluators-outside-langchain) that captures and compares the intermediate steps of the agent against a pre-defined sequence. This ensures that the agent isn't just providing the correct answers but is also being efficient about how it is using external resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic steps are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Prepare a dataset with input queries and expected agent actions\n",
        "- Define the agent with specific tools and behavior\n",
        "- Construct custom evaluators that check the actions taken\n",
        "- Running the evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the evaluation is completed, you can review the results in LangSmith. By the end of this guide, you'll have a better sense of how to apply an evaluator to more complex inputs like an agent's trajectory."
