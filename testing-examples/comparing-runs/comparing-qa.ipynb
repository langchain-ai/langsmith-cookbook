        "The most common way to compare two models is to benchmark them both on a dataset and compare the aggregate metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is useful but it may filter out helpful information about the quality of the two system variants. In this case, it can be helpful to directly perform pairwise comparisons on the responses and take the resulting preference scores into consideration.\n",

        "In this tutorial, we will share one way to do this in code. We will use a retrieval Q&A system over LangSmith's docs as a motivating example.\n",

        "The main steps are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Setup\n",
        "   - Create a dataset of questions and answers.\n",
        "   - Define different versions of your chains to evaluate.\n",
        "   - Evaluate chains directly on a dataset using regular metrics (e.g. correctness).\n",
        "4. Evaluate the pairwise preferences over that dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, we will test the impact of chunk sizes on our result quality. Let's begin!\n",

        "This tutorial uses OpenAI for the model, ChromaDB to store documents, and LangChain to compose the chain. To make sure the tracing and evals are set up for [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com), please configure your API Key appropriately.\n",
