Seller and Buyer are referred to individually at times as a \"Party\" and collectively at times as the \"Parties\".\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nA. Seller sells various types of products used in the consumer and food service markets.\\n\\nB. Buyer sells various types of products, including certain products of the type made by Seller, to its customers.\\n\\nC. The Parties are entering into this Agreement to establish the terms and conditions under which Seller may agree to sell specific products to Buyer, and Buyer may agree to purchase specific products from Seller for later resale by Buyer to its business customers.\\n\\nAGREEMENT\\n\\n1. Term. The \"Term\" of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will end on the earlier of: (a) the first anniversary of the expiration date of the last Purchase Schedule (as defined in this next Section); (b) a termination date elected by a Party in a written notice delivered to the other Party any time after the expiration of the last Purchase Schedule; or (c) a termination date elected by a Party in a written notice delivered to the other Party as provided in Subsection 11(d) of this Agreement. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement with respect to any (i) products purchased and sold under this Agreement during the Term and products sold after the Term for orders accepted during the Term; (ii) Confidential Information (as defined in Section 10 of this Agreement) disclosed or received by a Party during the Term; (iii) breach of this Agreement by a Party; (iv) any other statement, decision, act or omission of a Party concerning or related to this Agreement; (v) any Dispute (as defined in Section 11 of this Agreement) between the Parties concerning or related to this Agreement; (vi) products and other materials manufactured or maintained by Seller in inventory for sale to Buyer that Buyer is obligated to purchase under a Purchase Schedule; and (vii) any provision that expressly states that it will survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.\\n\\n2. Scope. This Agreement will apply to all products sold by Seller to Buyer, and all products purchased by Buyer from Seller, during the Term unless the Parties expressly agree that this Agreement will not apply to a particular type of transaction in a separate written document signed by an officer of each Party. This Agreement will not require Seller to sell any type or quantity of a product to Buyer, nor will this Agreement required Buyer to purchase any type or quantity of a product from Seller, except as expressly provided by the Parties in a Purchase Schedule. The phrase \"Purchase Schedule\" will mean a written supplement to this Agreement signed by an officer of each Party which references this Agreement and which identities, among other terms and conditions, the specific types and quantities of products that will be purchased and sold by the Parties on terms and conditions in the schedule, the specifications for the identified products, the duration of the commitment period during which the Parties will be obligated to purchase and sell the identified products on the terms and conditions in the schedule, the prices of the identified products, any mechanisms for adjusting the prices of the identified products over the commitment period, and the facilities at which the identified products will be manufactured, stored and delivered by Seller. The Parties may add terms and conditions to, and amend the terms and conditions of, this Agreement in a Purchase Schedule, but any additional and amended terms and conditions in a Purchase Schedule supplementing and modifying this Agreement will only apply the specific products identified in that Purchase Schedule for its duration.\\n\\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Standard Operating Procedures. Over approximately the past eight years, the Parties have been supplying select Products to one another for use in the operation of their respective businesses within the United States of America, Canada and Mexico. The Parties developed and been following certain standard operating procedures in connecting with, among other topics, forecasting, production planning, ordering, delivering and resolving claims on the Products supplied to one another (the \"Current SOPs\"). The Parties will be updating their respective business systems over the next six months, and the updates to these business systems will require the Parties to modify the Current SOPs. Once the Parties have completed the updates to the business systems and agreed on the necessary modifications to the Current SOPs, the Parties will sign a written amendment to this Agreement appending the updated standard operating procedures (the \"Updated SOPs\"). Until the Parties have signed a written amendment appending the Updated SOPs, the parties will continue to follow the Current SOPs. The Parties will comply with the applicable SOPs in connection with the purchase and sale of products identified in a Purchase Schedule. The Parties may add terms and conditions to, and amend the terms and conditions of, the SOP in a Purchase Schedule, but any additional and amended terms and conditions in a Purchase Schedule supplementing and modifying the SOP will only apply the specific products identified in that Purchase Schedule for its duration.\\n\\n4. Order and Priority of Interpretation. In the event of any conflict, inconsistency or ambiguity between two or more provisions in this Agreement, including the provisions in its Exhibits and Purchase Schedules, the provisions in the documents will govern, supersede and control over one another in the following order of priority: (1st) a Purchase Schedule with regards to the purchase and sale of the specific products identified in that Purchase Schedule for its duration; (2nd) the SOP; (3rd) any Exhibit to this Agreement but only with regards to specific subject matter of the Exhibit; and (4t h) the main body of this Agreement prior to the signature page.\\n\\n5. General Representations, Warranties and Covenants. A Party represents, warrant and covenants on the Effective Date and at all times during the Term that: a. The Party is formed, registered, licensed and operating its business in compliance with the laws of the United States of America, its states and territories, and any districts, municipalities and other political subdivisions of the foregoing (\"Applicable Laws\"). b. The Party is operating its business in compliance with a commercially reasonable code of ethics adopted by such Party. c. The Party may enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement without being in conflict with, or in breach of, any other agreement of the Party. d. The Party is solvent, is capable of paying its debts as and when they become due and is paying its debts as and when due. e. The Party is not the subject of a criminal investigation nor a defendant in any criminal indictment, petition, complaint or proceeding that carries a potential sentence involving incarceration in excess of one year for any director or executive officer of the Party involved in the alleged criminal misconduct or a fine in excess of $100,000 USD.\\n\\nA Party will promptly notify the other Party of any change in circumstance during the Term in which the Party is no longer in compliance with the foregoing general representations, warranties and covenants. An incident of actual, alleged or suspected non-compliance by a Party with a warranty under this Section being investigated, contested or corrected in good faith by the Party and which, regardless of outcome, will have no material adverse effect on the Party or its performance under this Agreement or on the other Party, will not be considered a breach of this clause. An incident of actual, alleged or suspected non-compliance by a Party of this Section or any other Section of this Agreement will be grounds for the other Party to demand adequate assurances of performance as provided by Section 2-609 of the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code. A Party will have ten (10) days to provide adequate assurances of performance to the other Party in a form acceptable to the other Party in its good faith discretion.\\n\\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6. Specific Product Warranties. Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that each product sold under this Agreement will at the time of delivery to Buyer: a. Be in new, undamaged and unadulterated condition free of any defects in design, materials and manufacture. Seller is not making any representation or warranty under this clause with regards to the design of a product to the extent the design constitutes, incorporates or otherwise embodies intellectual property that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller is owned by Buyer and which Buyer has licensed to Seller to manufacture the product for Buyer. b. Have been manufactured and stored by Seller at a plant (and, if applicable under a Purchase Schedule, a warehouse) of Seller approved in the applicable Purchase Schedule prior to its delivery to Buyer. c. Has been manufactured, packaged, labelled, sold and delivered by Seller, and may be sold by Buyer in interstate commerce, in compliance with Applicable Laws, including without limitation with food safety regulations issued by the United States Food and Drug Administration that are applicable to the product. Seller will not be in breach of this warranty because an Applicable Law prohibits, restricts or imposes a charge on a product in a district, municipality or other political subdivision of the United States of America or its states or territories. d. Comply with the written specifications for the product identified in the applicable Purchase Schedule. e. Be fit for the purpose of packaging, selling or use in consuming food subject to qualifications and instructions on the use of the product in the written specifications for the product identified in the applicable Purchase Schedule. f. Be conveyed by Seller to Buyer with good and marketable title free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and claims arising by, through or under Seller. g. Not infringe on any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other the intellectual property of any third-party registered or otherwise recognized and enforceable under Applicable Law. Seller is not making any representation or warranty under this clause with regards to the design of a product to the extent the design constitutes, incorporates or otherwise embodies intellectual property that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller is owned by Buyer and which Buyer has licensed to Seller to manufacture the product for Buyer. h. Comply with any additional representations and warranties of Seller regarding the product in the applicable Purchase Schedule.\\n\\nIf a Buyer receives a product that fails to conform to these representations and warranties, the sole remedies of Buyer for the breach of warranty will be to: (1) reject and return the non-conforming product to Seller for a refund or credit, or a replacement conforming product, in the manner and time period provided in the SOP; (2) obtain reimbursement from Seller for actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in the recovery, return or disposal of a non-conforming product that is the subject of a mandatory product recall required under Applicable Laws or a voluntary withdrawal declared by Seller or approved by Seller (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (3) obtain indemnification from Seller for any Indemnified Claim arising from or related to the non-conforming product as provided in Section 7.\\n\\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7. Indemnification. a. A claim that a Party (referred to at times in this Section as an \"Indemnifying Party\") is required to defend and indemnify the other Party (referred to at times in this Section as an \"Indemnified Party\") under this Agreement is referred to at times in this Section as an \"Indemnified Claim\". Defense and indemnification under this Section will include, without limitation, (1) paying or reimbursing the actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the investigation, defense and settlement of any civil, criminal or administrative action, suit, arbitration, mediation, hearing, audit, investigation or other proceeding threatened or commenced against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim (e.g., fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants, auditors, investigators, consulting experts, testifying experts and other consultants; fees and expenses of an arbitrator or mediator; filing fees and costs imposed by any court, administrative agency or other tribunal; etc.), and (2) satisfying any judgment, award, order, lien, levy, fine, penalty or other sanction imposed against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim. b. Seller will defend and indemnify Buyer against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Seller, including, without limitation, any product supplied by Seller which fails to conform to the representations and warranties in this Agreement; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Seller in the design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery of any product sold by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Seller under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, packaging, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement (except to the extent that the infringement is based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license terms in supplying the product); (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by a governmental authority on Buyer to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Seller of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Seller has agreed to defend and indemnify Buyer against under a Purchase Schedule. c. Buyer will defend and indemnify Seller against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Buyer; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Buyer in the purchase, storage, repackaging, resale or delivery of any product purchased from Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Buyer under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement to the extent based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license term in supplying the product; (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by governmental authority on Seller to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Buyer of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Buyer has agreed to defend and indemnify Seller against under a Purchase Schedule. d. As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and\\n\\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.\\n\\n8. Insurance. During the Term of this Agreement, each Party will maintain the following minimum types and amounts of insurance coverage during the Term of this Agreement: a. Commercial General Liability Insurance.

Limitations on Liability. a. Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties. Each Party: (1) disclaims all representations and warranties regarding its products, performance, supplied information or business, whether oral or written, express or implied, arising by operation of law or otherwise, including, without limitation, the implied warranty of merchantability and the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, other than those express representations and warranties of the Party in this Agreement; (2) acknowledges that the Party has not relied on, and will not rely on, any representations and warranties of the other Party regarding its products, performance, supplied information or business, whether oral or written, express or implied, arising by operation of law or otherwise, other than those express representations and warranties of the other Party in this Agreement; and (3) waives any claim that the Party may have based, in whole or in part, on any representations and warranties of the other Party regarding its products, performance, supplied information or business, whether oral or written, express or implied, arising by operation of law or otherwise, other than those express representations and warranties of the other Party in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer is entitled to rely on (i) the descriptive information in transaction documents issued by either Party in the ordinary course of business during the Term identifying the ordered Products (e.g., the type and quantity of ordered products and scheduled date and location for delivery) and (ii) FDA guaranty letters and other similar written assurances in Seller\\'s standard forms certifying that a product complies with Applicable Laws issued by Seller to Buyers and other U.S. customers in the ordinance course of business during the Term. b. Exclusion of Indirect Damages; Waiver of Claim for Insured Damage or Loss. A Party that breaches this Agreement will only be liable to the other Party for direct damages arising from the breach. Each Party waives any right to recover consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary, punitive or any other types of indirect damages from the other Party for a breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, this Subsection will not limit the liability of a Party for any amount or type of damages for: (1) the defense and indemnification of an Indemnified Claim on which the Party is the Indemnifying Party; (2) infringement by the Party on the intellectual property of the other Party; (3) the unauthorized disclosure or use by the Party of the Confidential Information of the other Party; (4) payment or reimbursement of any amount expressly required to be paid or reimbursed by the Party under a provision of this Agreement; or (5) the intentional misconduct of the Party in violation of Applicable Laws. c. Force Majeure. A Party will not be considered in breach of this Agreement or liable to the other Party for any interruption or delay in performance under this Agreement to the extent caused by an event outside of the ability of the performing Party to foresee and avoid with the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts (such an event is referred to at times as an event of \"Force Majeure\"). Examples of events of Force Majeure include, without limitation: natural disasters; war; acts of terrorism; government action; accident; strikes, slowdowns and other labor disputes; shortages in or inability to obtain material, equipment, transportation or labor; any breach, negligence, criminal misconduct or other act or omission of any third-party; fire or other insured or uninsured casualty. A Party whose performance is interrupted or delayed by an event of Force Majeure will be excused from the interruption or delay in performance during the event of Force Majeure and for a commercially reasonable period of additional time after the event of Force Majeure that the Party needs to recover from the event of Force Majeure and restore performance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party will only be excused for an interruption or delay in performance under this Subsection for an event of Force Majeure only if the Party (1) promptly notifies the other Party of the event of Force Majeure and provides information reasonably requested by the other Party regarding the event of Force Majeure, the efforts undertaken by the\\n\\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nParty to foresee and avoid interruption or delay in its performance before the occurrence of the event, to mitigate interruption or delay in performance during the event, and to recover from and restore performance following the event; and (2) the Party exercises commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate, recover from and restore performance following the event of Force Majeure. During, and while recovering from and restoring performance following, an event of Force Majeure, Seller will act in good faith in allocating its available manufacturing capacity to supply products to Buyer under this Agreement and any products to other customers of Seller. If an event of Force Majeure interrupts or delays Seller from supplying a product to Buyer under this Agreement in the quantities and timetable required by Buyer, Buyer may cancel any unfilled orders for the product with Seller and procure the required quantities of the product from one or more other sources until Seller has recovered from and restored its ability to perform following the event of Force Majeure. If the interruption or delay in the supply of a product to Buyer under this Agreement caused by an event of Force Majeure has exceeded, or is reasonably likely to exceed, thirty (30) days, Buyer may enter into longer term supply agreements or make other arrangements to procure the required quantities of the product from one or more other sources for a duration and on terms acceptable to Buyer in its good faith discretion. In such a circumstance, Buyer will not have to resume purchasing the product from Seller under this Agreement until Seller has recovered from and restored its ability to perform following the event of Force Majeure and the longer term agreements or other arrangements have expired or Buyer is able to end them without liability. This Subsection will not excuse nor extend a deadline by which a Party must pay an amount owed under this Agreement or Applicable Law or by which a Party must exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement or Applicable Law.\\n\\n10. Confidential Information and Other Intellectual Property. a. The Parties anticipate exchanging Confidential Information (as defined in in the next Subsection) over the Term of this Agreement for the purpose of negotiating and entering into Purchase Schedules and amendments to this Agreement, transacting business with one in accordance with this Agreement and exercising their rights and performing their obligations under this Agreement (collectively referred to as the \"Authorized Purpose\"). b. The phrase \"Confidential Information\" means information meeting all of the following criteria: 1) The information is a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information owned by a Party or its direct and indirect subsidiaries under Applicable Law (this Party is referred to at times in this Section as the \"Disclosing Party\"); and 2) The other Party (referred to at times in this Section as the \"Receiving Party\") requests such information from the Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose during the Term (i.e., neither Party wants unsolicited Confidential Information from the other Party); and 3) The Disclosing Party discloses such requested information to the Receiving Party during the Term either labelled as \"Confidential\" or words of similar intent, or describes the disclosed information in reasonable detail in a written notice to the Receiving Party delivered, either at the time of disclosure or within five (5) days of disclosure. If a Disclosing Party neglects to label or deliver timely written notice to the Receiving Party identifying the disclosed information as confidential in nature, the disclosed information will only be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement if the Disclosing Party is able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Receiving Party knew that the disclosed information was a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information of the Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe criteria in Clause (2) and Clause (3) will not apply to Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party observed or heard by a Receiving Party in a plant, warehouse, facility or system of the Disclosing Party. The existence and terms of this Agreement, and the existence, nature and extent of the business relationship between the Parties, will be considered the Confidential Information of each Party. c. The phrase \"Confidential Information\" also means the Know-How of a Disclosing Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries that a Receiving Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries learned of, acquired or otherwise used prior to the Effective Date. The phrase \"Know-How\" means trade secret and other confidential, proprietary information of a Party or its Affiliate concerning the manufacture, storage, packaging, marketing, sale and delivery of its products. Examples of Know-How may be in the form of drawings, equipment specifications, formulae, formulations, guidelines, manuals, methods, plans, policies, procedures, processes, properties and applications of raw materials and products, tools, dies and molds. A Receiving Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries may continue to use the Know- How of the Disclosing Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries in the possession of the Receiving Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries as of the Effective Date for the Authorized Purpose and in connection with the operation of the business of the Receiving Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Nothing in this Subsection or any other provisions of this Agreement will obligate a Party to disclose or license the use of its Know-How of any kind and in any form arising, discovered, acquired or developed after the Effective Date to the other Party. d. The phrase \"Confidential Information\" does not include, and there will not be any duties of confidentiality or other restrictions under this Agreement for, the following types of information: (1) Information which is or becomes available as part of the public domain through any means other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; or (2) Information, other than Know-How received prior the Effective Date, which is known to the Receiving Party before the disclosure of the same information by the Disclosing Party; or (3) Information which is or becomes available to the Receiving Party from a third-party who is not under any duty to preserve the confidentiality of such information; or (4) Information which is furnished by the Disclosing Party to a third-party without imposing any duty on the third-party to preserve the confidentiality of such information; or (5) Information which is independently developed by the Receiving Party without the use of or reliance on any trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information provided by the Disclosing Party as Confidential Information under this Agreement or under any prior agreement between the Parties; or (6) Information that ceases to be a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information of the Disclosing Party under applicable law through any means other than those enumerated above that does not involve nor result from a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party. e. A Party may request and disclose Confidential Information in any form or medium. Confidential Information may include, without limitation, information concerning the assets, liabilities, financing, financial statements, ownership, goods, services, customers, suppliers, marketing, manufacturing, equipment, software, technology, supply chain, business strategies, plans, models, policies, methods, processes, formulae, specifications, drawings, schematics, software and technical know-how of a Disclosing Party. A Receiving Party will take all commercially reasonable actions required to safeguard the Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party in the possession of such Receiving Party against the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information by other persons. A Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party if the Receiving Party learns of any unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party by any\\n\\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nperson. A Receiving Party will cooperate in good faith with the Disclosing Party to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party by any person. f. A Receiving Party will not disclose nor use the Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party except as follows: (1) A Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party on a \"need to know\" basis to the Representatives of the Receiving Party who require such information for the Authorized Purpose and in order for the Receiving Party and its Affiliates to comply with Applicable Laws, accounting standards and securities exchange requirements. Before making such a disclosure, the Receiving Party will advise the Representatives of the confidential nature of the information being shared and ensure that duties and restrictions are, or have been, imposed on the Representatives receiving the Confidential Information similar to those imposed on the Receiving Party under this Agreement. A Receiving Party will be liable for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives. An \"Affiliate\" of a Party means a legal entity that owns and controls, or is owned and controlled by, or is under common ownership and control with, a Party (other than the other Party or any of its direct and indirect subsidiaries), with ownership and control of a legal entity being determined by the ownership of the majority voting interest in the legal entity. A \"Representative\" means the Affiliates of a Party and the directors, officers, managers, employees, accountants, attorneys, auditors and other agents and consultants of a Party and its Affiliates. (2) A Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party to a court, governmental entity or any other person in order for the Receiving Party and its Affiliates to comply with Applicable Laws, accounting standards and securities exchange requirements. If legally permissible and reasonably possible, a Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party prior to disclosing its Confidential Information pursuant to this Section and cooperate in good faith with any lawful efforts by the Disclosing Party to avoid or limit the disclosure of its Confidential Information. A Receiving Party will not be obligated to incur any liability, expense or risk in extending such cooperation to a Disclosing Party. Based on legal advice of its attorney, a Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party by any deadline established under an Applicable Law, accounting standard and securities exchange requirement. (3) A Receiving Party may disclose and use the Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party to enforce or interpret this Agreement or any other agreement with the Disclosing Party in any arbitration, court or other legal proceeding. A Receiving Party may disclose and use this Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party to defend the Receiving Party or its Affiliates or their respective Representatives in any arbitration, court or other legal proceeding. In either circumstance, the Receiving Party will ensure that a protective order, agreement or other mechanism is in place to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. (4) A Receiving Party and its Representatives may disclose and use the Confidential Information for any other purpose consented to by a Disclosing Party in a written notice signed by an officer of the Disclosing Party delivered to the Receiving Party. g. In disclosing its Confidential Information to a Receiving Party, a Disclosing Party represents, warrants and covenants to the Receiving Party that: (1) The Disclosing Party owns and has the right to disclose and authorize the use of Confidential Information as provided in this Agreement.\\n\\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2) The Receiving Party and its Representatives may use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose and other limited purposes provided in this Agreement. (3) The Disclosing Party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Receiving Party and its Representatives against any claim of a third-party that the disclosure and use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as provided in this Agreement infringes on a patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property of the third-party registered in or otherwise recognized and enforceable under Applicable Laws.\\n\\nExcept for the limited representations and warranties in this Section, a Disclosing Party disclaims all other representations and warranties of any kind related to its Confidential Information, whether express, implied or arising by operation of law, including the disclaimer, without limitation, of any representation and warranties concerning merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, truth, accuracy or completeness. h. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Section with regards to disclosed Confidential Information will continue: (1) Until the earlier of (i) sixty (60) months from the date of disclosure to a Receiving Party or (ii) the date such information ceases to be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement, for Confidential Information that is not a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law; and (2) Until Confidential Information that is a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law ceases to be a trade secret of the Disclosing Party under Applicable Law. i. A Receiving Party will return or destroy all forms of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in the custody of the Receiving Party and its Representatives within ten (10) days of receipt of a written request from the Disclosing Party and after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement. This will include, without limitation, all copies, records, documents and other information representing, comprising, containing, referencing or created based on Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Receiving Party and its Representatives may retain copies of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party which (x) the Receiving Party and its Representatives are required to retain to comply with Applicable Laws, accounting standards and security exchange requirements (but only for the duration and in the manner so required for this limited purpose); or (y) have been archived in electronic form by the Receiving Party and its Representatives and which would be unduly burdensome for the Receiving Party and its Representatives to have to search for and delete the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. j. Except for the limited right to disclose and use Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose and other purposes provided in the this Section and except for any license of intellectual property granted by a Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party in a Purchase Schedule, this Agreement does not grant a Receiving Party or its Representatives any right, title, interest or ownership in the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party nor in any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property of the Disclosing Party. As between the Parties during the Term, to be effective, the grant of any right, title, interest and ownership in and to any Confidential Information of Party or in an patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property of the Party must be in writing and signed by the chief executive officers of the Parties. During the Term, a Party will not develop intellectual property for, on behalf of, or in collaboration with, the other Party unless the Parties have entered into a Purchase Schedule or other separate written agreement signed by an officer of each Party.\\n\\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11.

Mediation. If the Parties have been unable to resolve a Dispute through good faith negotiation as provided in the prior Subsection, a Party may request that the Parties attempt to resolve the Dispute through mediation by notifying the other Party with a copy to JAMS. The Parties will attempt to select a mutually acceptable JAMS mediator within ten (10) days of the notice requesting mediation. The mediation will be held in Lake County or Cook County, Illinois within thirty (30) days of the notice requesting mediation before a JAMS mediator and in compliance with JAMS mediation guidelines. Each party will bear its own costs in preparing for and participating in the mediation and one-half of the fees and expenses charged by JAMS for conducting the mediation. c. Litigation. If the Parties have been unable to resolve a Dispute through mediation as provided in the prior Subsection, a Party may file litigation against the other Party in a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States of America. With respect to litigation involving only the Parties or their Affiliates, the Parties irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the U.S. federal and Illinois state courts of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in Lake County, Illinois or Cook County, Illinois and their respective higher courts of appeal for the limited purpose of resolving a Dispute, and the Parties waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defense of inconvenient forum. The Parties waive any right to trial by jury as to any Disputes resolved through litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may file litigation to resolve a Dispute without undergoing either negotiation or mediation as provided in the prior Subsections for any Dispute involving: (i) infringement on intellectual property; (ii) the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information; or (iii) a request for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or any other type of equitable relief. d. Remedies. Except as expressly limited in the preceding Subsections and the other provisions in this Agreement, a Party may immediately exercise any rights and remedies available to the Party under Applicable Law upon a breach of this Agreement by the other Party. A Party will not suspend performance under or terminate this Agreement or any accepted purchase order for a product being purchased and sold under this Agreement unless: (1) the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement and has either refused to cure the material breach or has failed to cure the material breach within thirty (30) day of its receipt of written notice of the failure; and (2) the Parties have been unable to resolve the Dispute related to the material breach through negotiation or mediation, or the breaching Party has refused or failed to attempt to resolve the Dispute through negotiation or mediation, as provided in this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may suspend performance or terminate this Agreement or any accepted purchase order for a product being purchase and sold under this Agreement immediately on written notice to the other Party, and without providing the other Party an opportunity to cure the material breach or attempting to resolve a Dispute over the material breach by negotiation or mediation as provided in this Section, for a material breach by the other Party involving substantial harm to the reputation, goodwill and business of the non-breaching Party that cannot reasonably be avoided or fully redressed by providing the other Party an opportunity to cure the material breach. e. Late Fees and Collection Costs. If Buyer fails to pay Seller an amount owed under this Agreement by the invoice due date, then Buyer will owe Seller: (i) the delinquent amount; and (ii) a late payment fee equal to two percent (2%) of the delinquent amount for each full or partial calendar month past the invoice due date that the delinquent amount remains unpaid. In addition, if Seller has to file\\n\\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlitigation to collect the amount owed and Seller prevails in the litigation, Buyer will reimburse Seller for actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in collecting the delinquent amount and accrued late payment fees on the delinquent amount. Under no circumstance will the late payment fee payable to Seller exceed the amount that a creditor may lawfully impose on a debtor on a delinquent amount under Applicable Law.\\n\\n12.

This Section does not prevent the reliance on the descriptive information in transaction documents identifying the ordered Products (e.g., the type and quantity of ordered products and scheduled date and location for delivery). No amendment of this Agreement will be valid or effective unless made in writing and signed and exchanged by the chief executive officers of the Parties. A Party may approve or reject a request for an amendment in its sole and absolute discretion. c. Waiver. The failure of either party to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to take advantage of any of its rights shall not operate as a continuing waiver of such rights. No right or obligation under this Agreement will be considered to have been waived by a Party unless such waiver is in writing and is signed by an officer of the waiving Party and delivered to the other Party. No consent to or waiver of a breach by either Party will constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any other, different, or subsequent breach by such Party. d. Governing Law.

A change of control shall be deemed an assignment requiring consent hereunder provided that any transfer or assignment that results in Seller\\'s and Buyer\\'s current common parent, Reynolds Group Holdings Limited, ceasing to control either party shall not require consent of the other party. The restrictions in this Section will not preclude a Party for authorizing an Affiliate to purchase or sell a product on behalf of a Party under this Agreement.

COMMENCEMENT OF APPOINTMENT 2.1 The Appointment will begin on 27 January 2020 or such other date as the parties shall agree and when the Executive is not subject to any restrictions to prevent the commencement of his employment with the Company. There is no period of previous employment with the Company. 2.2 The Appointment may be terminated in accordance with clause 15 (or in furtherance of any right either party may have at common law). 3. EXECUTIVE\\'S DUTIES 3.1 The Executive shall serve the Company as Chief Financial Officer and as an Executive Director of WPP plc, and/or in such other capacity or capacities, within the Group as the Company may reasonably require from time to time, but subject always to it being consistent with his status, skills and experience. 3.2 During the Appointment the Executive shall: (a) diligently exercise such powers and perform such duties as may from time to time be assigned to him by the Board of WPP plc; (b) accept any offices or directorships as reasonably required by the Company; (c) use his best endeavours to promote, protect, develop and extend the business of the Company and any Group Company; (d) comply with all reasonable and lawful directions given to him by the Board of WPP plc; (e) comply with all policies and procedures of the Company and/or the Group.

PLACE OF WORK 4.1 The Executive\\'s normal place of work shall be the Company\\'s head office in the UK from time to time as the Company may reasonably determine, for the proper performance of his duties. The Executive shall travel to such places (inside and) outside the UK as may be required in order to properly perform his duties, in particular, to the head office in the USA. In connection therewith, the Executive is likely from time to time to be required to work outside the UK for periods exceeding one month. 4.2 There are currently no additional terms which apply where the Executive is required to work outside the UK for a period exceeding one month, but the Company reserves the right to issue such terms, and any such terms will be notified to the Executive. 5. WORKING HOURS 5.1 The parties agree that the Executive\\'s role and senior status are such that the Executive will determine the whole of his working time himself and his working time cannot be measured or pre-determined and, accordingly, that the Appointment falls within the scope of Regulation 20 of the Working Time Regulations 1998, meaning that the restrictions on working time set out in the Working Time Regulations do not apply to him. 5.2 During the Appointment, unless prevented by ill-health or accident and except during holiday taken in accordance with clause 11, the Executive shall devote the whole of his time, skill and attention during normal business hours, and at such other times as may be reasonably necessary (without additional remuneration), to his duties under this Agreement. 6. REMUNERATION 6.1 The Company will pay the Executive a salary of £740,000 and a fixed benefits allowance of £30,000 per annum. The salary (and so far, as is reasonably possible) the benefits allowance will accrue from day to day and be payable in equal instalments in arrears on or around the 25th day of every month, less deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions and shall be inclusive of any fees receivable by the Executive as a director of any Group Company. 6.2 The Executive\\'s salary will be reviewed by the Compensation Committee every two years. There will be no salary review after notice to terminate this Agreement has been given by either party. The Company has no obligation to increase the Executive\\'s salary following a review. 6.3 The Executive will be eligible to participate in any bonus or discretionary remuneration plan on such terms as the Compensation Committee may from time to time decide and always subject to the terms of the Executive Remuneration policy as approved by shareholders of WPP plc and to additional terms and conditions including the malus and clawback provisions of all relevant share or stock plans and as referred to in Schedule 2. 6.4 Any bonus payment to the Executive shall be purely discretionary and shall not form part of the Executive\\'s contractual remuneration under this Agreement. Payment of a bonus to the Executive in 5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\none year shall confer no right on the Executive to receive a bonus in any other year. Specifically, but without limitation, the Executive shall have no right to be considered for, or payment of, a bonus where the Executive is subject to, or may about to be subject to, an ongoing investigation or disciplinary process into facts or matters which could lead to such bonus being forfeited, or reduced and in all events if the Appointment has terminated for any reason or if he is under notice of termination whether given by the Executive or the Company at or prior to the date when a bonus might otherwise have been payable. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Executive is exonerated of any of the allegations made during any such disciplinary process or if any investigation does not result in any material action against the Executive, he will (once the disciplinary process or investigation is concluded) have the right to be considered for a bonus as if there had been no such investigation or disciplinary process. If any bonus becomes payable in such circumstances it will be paid without delay following the conclusion of the disciplinary process or investigation. 6.5 The Executive hereby irrevocably consents to the Company, at any time during the Appointment or on its termination (however arising), deducting from salary or any other payments due to the Executive in respect of the Appointment any monies due from him to the Company or any Group Company. 6.6 The Executive agrees that every benefit arising out of or in connection with his employment whilst he remains a director is subject to change (including detrimental change without compensation) where any particular benefit paid, or otherwise owing or becoming payable to him in the future, breaches or may breach the terms of the shareholder approved Executive Compensation Policy at any time. 7. EXPENSES\\n\\nThe Company will reimburse the Executive (on production of such evidence as it may reasonably require) the amount of all travelling and other expenses properly and reasonably incurred by him in the discharge of his duties in strict accordance with the Company\\'s expenses policy from time to time. 8. PENSION 8.1 The Company operates a Group pension plan (the Plan). The Executive is entitled to participate in the Plan (or such pension scheme as may be established by the Company to replace the Plan), subject to its trust deeds and rules from time to time. The Executive has opted out of the Plan. Whilst his status remains so, he will receive in lieu the annual sum of 10% of his current salary, paid monthly in instalments, together with his salary. 8.2 The Company reserves the right to terminate the Plan at any time without replacing it. In this event, and assuming he is, or has been, a member, the Executive\\'s rights (if any) will be in accordance with the said trust deeds and rules. 8.3 The Executive has been grated Fixed Protection. The Company acknowledges that once the Executive has informed the Company that he has Fixed Protection, under Regulation 5D of the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Automatic Enrolment) Regulations 2010 it does not need to automatically-enrol or automatically re-enrol the Executive into a pension scheme. The Company therefore agrees not to enrol the Executive in the Plan or any other pension scheme at any time after the Executive has informed the Company that he has Fixed Protection 2016,\\n\\nThe Company agrees in the meantime that it will not enrol the Executive into the Plan or any other pension scheme unless it is compelled to do so by law or the parties agree in writing otherwise. If the Company is compelled to enrol the Executive into the Plan or another pension scheme under law, or the Executive opts to join the Plan or any other pension scheme the Executive acknowledges and agrees that: 6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n(a) the Company has no liability to him if payment of any contribution to, or the provision of any benefit under, the Plan (whether by itself or when aggregated with any contribution to or any increase in value of the Executive\\'s rights under any other arrangement) gives rise to an annual allowance or lifetime allowance charge (within the meaning of the Finance Act 2004) and that the Company has no responsibility to make any enquiry or advise the Executive as to the possibility of any such charge; (b) he is liable for reporting and paying any such charge in accordance with the Finance Act 2004; and (c) the Company has no liability to him in respect of any loss for any reason of enhanced protection, fixed protection, fixed protection 2014, fixed protection 2016 or any similar protection allowed in future (for the purposes of the Finance Act 2004) if applicable to the Executive. 9. INSURANCES 9.1 In partial spend of the fixed benefits allowance referred to in sub-clause 6.1, the Executive and his spouse or civil partner and any children under the age of 21 (or 24 if in full time education) are entitled to membership of a private medical insurance scheme. 9.2 The Executive is entitled to membership of a Group income protection plan and life assurance cover, which will be paid for by the Company. 9.3 Participation in all insurance schemes from time to time is subject to: (a) the terms of the relevant insurance scheme, as amended from time to time; (b) the rules or the insurance policy of the relevant insurance provider, or WPP Healthcare Trust as amended from time to time; and (c) the Executive (and where relevant any other potential beneficiary) satisfying the normal underwriting requirements of the relevant insurance provider and the premium being at a rate which the Company considers reasonable. 9.4 If the insurer refuses for any reason to provide the benefit to the Executive (or any relevant dependant) the Company shall not be liable to provide to the Executive any replacement benefit of the same or similar kind or to pay any compensation in lieu of such benefit. Full details of the insurance schemes are available from the Company\\'s Worldwide Compensation and Benefits Director. 9.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Company\\'s sole obligations in respect of the insurance benefits referred to in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2 is to pay the premia from time to time requested by the provider and to pay to the Executive any sums as may from time to time be received by the Company from the provider in respect of any claim made by the Executive (for him or a dependent) under any insurance scheme. 9.6 The Company shall have the right at its sole discretion to alter the cover provided or any term of any insurance scheme or to cease to provide (without replacement) any insurance scheme or cover at any time. 9.7 The Executive is entitled to the benefit of any indemnity in the Company\\'s articles of association and may also entitled to the benefit of cover under such directors and officers liability insurance policy as may be maintained by the Company from time to time. 7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n10. SICKNESS ABSENCE 10.1 If the Executive cannot attend work due to sickness or injury, the Executive will keep the Chairman informed of his condition and, where the absence lasts for a period of seven calendar days or more, the Executive will (at the request of the Company) produce a doctor\\'s certificate to the Company in respect of his absence. (a) Provided the Executive complies with the Company\\'s sickness absence notification and certification requirements, the Executive shall be entitled to receive his full salary and contractual benefits during any period of sickness absence not exceeding 26 weeks in any rolling period of 12 months. These payments shall be inclusive of any Statutory Sick Pay due. No payment of salary will be made during any subsequent period of absence when the Executive is eligible to receive benefits under the Group income protection plan referred to in sub clause 9.2. 10.2 If the Company so reasonably requires, the Executive agrees to consent to a medical examination by a medical practitioner nominated by the Company, at the Company\\'s expense.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 13.1 In this clause 13, Confidential Information means information (whether or not recorded in documentary form, or stored on any magnetic or optical disk or memory) relating, without limitation, to the business, clients, customers, products, affairs and finances of the Company or any Group Company for the time being confidential to the Company or any Group Company or in relation to which the Company or any Group Company is subject to a duty of confidentiality and trade secrets including, without limitation, technical data and know-how relating to the business of the Company or any Group Company or of any persons having dealings with the Company or any Group Company, whether or not such information (if it is not in oral form) is marked confidential, and includes, without limitation: (a) existing and prospective activities of the Company or any Group Company, including timing, business plans and financial information; (b) existing and prospective terms of business, prices and pricing strategies and structures, profit margins, trading arrangements, discounts and rebates of the Company or any Group Company; (c) existing and prospective marketing information, plans, strategies, tactics and timing relating to the Company or any Group Company; (d) existing and prospective lists of suppliers and rates of charge relating to the Company or any Group Company; (e) existing and prospective financial and other products or services, including applications, designs, technical data and qualifications relating to the Company or any Group Company; (f) existing and prospective software applications relating to the Company or any Group Company; (g) information relating to existing and prospective officers, employees and consultants of the Company or any Group Company including their engagement, their contractual terms including commission and bonuses and information relating to the termination of their employment or appointment with the Company or any Group Company; (h) any disputes and litigation proposed, in progress or settled in relation to the Company or any Group Company; (i) any invention, technical data, know-how or other manufacturing information of the Group or its customers/clients; and (j) existing and prospective research and development activities. 13.2 The Executive must not make use of or divulge to any person or entity, and must use his best endeavours to prevent the unauthorised use, publication or disclosure of, any Confidential 9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nInformation which is disclosed or made available to the Executive, either directly or indirectly, during the course of, or in connection with, the Executive\\'s employment or his holding any office within the Group from any source within the Company or any Group Company and shall be under an obligation promptly to report to the Group any such unauthorised use or disclosure which comes to his knowledge. 13.3 This clause 13 does not apply to information which: (a) is used or disclosed in the proper performance of the Executive\\'s duties or with the prior written consent of the Company or any Group Company; (b) is ordered to be disclosed by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise required to be disclosed by law; (c) is already in the public domain (other than as a result of unauthorised disclosure by the Executive or any other person); or (d) is already lawfully possessed by the Executive without any obligations of confidentiality or restrictions on use. 13.4 The Executive shall not, during the Appointment or at any time thereafter, make, except for the benefit of the Company or any Group Company, any copy, record or memorandum (whether or not recorded in writing or on computer disk or tape) of any Confidential Information and any such copy, record or memorandum made by the Executive during the Appointment shall be and remain the property of the Company and accordingly shall be returned by the Executive to the Company on the Termination Date or when required to do so by the Company. 13.5 The Executive shall not other than in the ordinary course of the Appointment without the prior written consent of the Board either directly or indirectly publish any opinion, fact or material or deliver any lecture or address or participate in the making of any film, radio broadcast or television transmission or communicate with any representative of the media or any third party relating to: (a) the business or affairs of the Company or of any other Group Company or to any of its or their officers, employees, customers, clients, suppliers, distributors, agents or shareholders; or (b) the development or exploitation of any Intellectual Property Rights, including Confidential Information. 13.6 Each of the restrictions in each sub clause above will be enforceable independently of each of the others and its validity will not be affected if any of the others are invalid. If any of those restrictions are void but would be valid if some part of the restriction were deleted, the restriction in question will apply with such modification as may be necessary to make it valid. 13.7 For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement precludes the Executive from making a protected disclosure within the meaning of Part 4A (Protected Disclosures) of the Employment Rights Act 1996. 14.

This assignment shall take effect upon the creation of each of the Intellectual Property Rights but if for any reason this does not occur, he agrees that he will hold all such Intellectual Property Rights on trust for the benefit of the Company until such time as it does. 14.4 The Executive agrees to sign all documents and to do all other acts which the Company requests (at its expense) to enable the Company to enjoy the full benefit of this clause 14. This includes joining in any application, which may be made in the Company\\'s sole name for registration of any Intellectual Property Rights (such as a patent, trademark or registered design), and assisting the Company in defending and enforcing such rights during and after the employment (at the Company\\'s expense). 14.5 Without prejudice to the generality of clause 13 (Confidential Information), the Executive may only use the Intellectual Property Rights and IP Materials to perform his obligations under this Agreement, and shall not disclose any Intellectual Property Rights or IP Materials to any third party without the express prior written consent of the Company. 14.6 The Executive waives all moral rights in IP Materials to which he may otherwise be entitled under the law of any relevant jurisdiction and which cannot be vested or assigned pursuant to sub clause 14.2 or 14.3.

If the Company elects to terminate the Executive\\'s employment in this way, it will make, within 30 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions.

Any delay by the Company in exercising its rights shall not constitute a waiver thereof. 15.10 On the Termination Date or, at the request of the Board on either party giving notice to terminate this Agreement, the Executive will immediately: (a) deliver to the Company all other property in his possession, custody or under his control belonging to any Group Company including (but not limited to) computers and any other electronic devices, business cards, credit and charge cards, security passes, original and copy documents or other media on which information is held in his possession relating to the business or affairs of any Group Company; and (b) to the extent possible, irretrievably delete (without keeping any copies in any format) any information relating to the business or affairs of the Company or any Group Company or any of its or their business contacts from any computer or communications systems, including any website or email account, owned or used by the Executive outside the Company\\'s premises and notify the Company of any passwords the Executive used in relation to its computer system. 15.11 If the Executive\\'s rights or benefits under any share option or share incentive scheme in which the Executive may participate (as set out at the date hereof in Schedule 2) are affected by the termination of the Employment, his rights will be determined solely in accordance with the rules of the relevant scheme and the Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation for the loss of any rights or benefits under such scheme. 15.12 If the Appointment is terminated for the purpose of the reconstruction or amalgamation of the Company or by reason of the Company transferring all or a substantial part of its business to another company and the Executive is offered employment by the reconstructed or amalgamated or transferee company on similar terms to the terms of this Agreement, the Executive will have no claim 13\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nagainst the Company or such reconstructed or amalgamated or transferee company in respect of the termination of the Appointment. 16. GARDEN LEAVE 16.1 Following service of notice to terminate the Appointment by either party or if the Executive purports to terminate the Appointment in breach, the Board may suspend all or any of the Executive\\'s duties and powers for such periods and on such terms as he considers expedient and this may include a term that: (a) the Executive must stay away from all or any of the Company\\'s premises, and/or (b) will not be provided with any work, and/or (c) will have no business contact with all or any of the Group\\'s agents, employees, customers, clients, distributors and suppliers, and/or (d) will have no access to the Company\\'s communications systems.\\n\\n(referred to as Garden Leave). 16.2 During any period of Garden Leave the Company will continue to pay the Executive\\'s salary, benefits allowance and maintain the benefits to which he is contractually entitled prior to the commencement of his Garden Leave (for the avoidance of doubt the Executive shall not be entitled to any bonus or discretionary payment(s) during any period of Garden Leave). 16.3 During any period of Garden Leave may appoint a replacement to exercise any of the Executive\\'s duties and responsibilities and may require the Executive to take such actions as he reasonably requires to effect a proper handover of any of his duties and responsibilities. Alternatively, the Company may require the Executive to carry out exceptional duties or special projects outside the normal scope of his duties and responsibilities (provided such projects are broadly commensurate with his status). 16.4 During any period of Garden Leave the Executive\\'s employment will continue and the Executive will continue to be bound by his obligations under this Agreement and by his general duties of fidelity and good faith (and, where applicable, as a fiduciary). The Executive agrees that the Company may, if it so chooses, announce to third parties that the Executive has resigned or been given notice (as the case may be) but the Executive will not make any comment on his status or change of duties, except to confirm he is on garden leave. 17. OFFICE AS A DIRECTOR 17.1 Any office or directorship which the Executive holds in any Group Company is subject to the articles of association of the relevant company from time to time. 17.2 The Executive is required to familiarise himself with all his responsibilities as a director, legal and/or otherwise. 17.3 Upon termination of this Agreement, or on the Board\\'s request, the Executive will resign from any office held by him in any Group Company without any claim for compensation. 17.4 The Executive shall, at the time of signing this Agreement, appoint the Company as his attorney by executing a Power of Attorney in the form set out in Schedule 1 so that the Company can give effect to the provisions of sub clause 17.3 above and clause 14 above as required. 14\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n17.5 In the event that the Executive fails to be re-elected as a director of any Group Company, or if the Executive resigns as a director of any Group Company at the Company\\'s request, this Agreement shall not automatically terminate and the Executive will continue as an employee of the Company unless and until either party elect to terminate the employment (either in accordance with clause 15.1, or where the Company may have a right to terminate his employment summarily under clause 15 or at common law). 17.6 The Executive must not resign from any directorship or office of any Group Company, except on termination of this Agreement (by either party), on the Board\\'s request or as provided in the articles of association of the Company, and he must not do anything that would cause him to be disqualified from continuing to act as a director. 18. PROTECTIVE COVENANTS 18.1 The Executive acknowledges that his senior position with the Company and any Group Company gives him access to and the benefit of confidential information vital to the continuing business of the Company and any Group Company and influence over and connection with the Company\\'s customers, clients, suppliers, distributors, agents, employees, workers, consultants and directors and those of any Group Company in or with which the Executive is engaged or in contact and acknowledges and agrees that the provisions in Schedule 3 are reasonable in their application to him and necessary but no more than sufficient to protect the interests of the Company and any Group Company. 18.2 If any person offers to the Executive any arrangement, contractual or otherwise, and whether paid or unpaid, which might or would cause the Executive to breach any of the covenants in Schedule 3, he will notify that person of the terms of that Schedule 3 and provide that person with a complete copy of it. 19. DATA PROTECTION 19.1 The Company takes its data protection obligations very seriously and complies with its legal obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018 to protect the privacy and security of the Executive\\'s personal information. As a data controller the Company is required to inform the Executive how we hold and use his information. 20. GRIEVANCE AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE 20.1 If the Executive is dissatisfied with any disciplinary decision relating to him, including any decision to dismiss him, he will have the right to appeal to the Chairman of WPP plc, whose decision will be final. 20.2 If the Executive seeks to redress any grievance relating to his employment, the Executive should raise this in the first instance with the Chairman. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved, the Executive should then apply in writing to the Board and the Board\\'s decision will be final. 20.3 The Company may suspend the Executive from any or all of his duties for as long as is reasonably necessary to investigate any matter in which the Executive is implicated or involved, whether directly or indirectly, or in the event that the Company believes that the Executive\\'s presence in the office would be detrimental to any investigation or to other employees or to the Executive. The provisions of clause 16.1 (a) to (d) and 16.2 will apply during any such period of suspension, with any additional terms depending on the circumstances that may be notified to the Executive in writing at that time. 15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n21.

and/or (ii) any STIP award or part of a STIP award paid to him in satisfaction of any STIP award under this Agreement must be repaid by the Executive. 4.2 This sub-clause 4.2 applies if, at any time prior to the third anniversary of the payment of any STIP awarded pursuant to this Agreement, the Compensation Committee determines that any of the circumstances described in sub-clauses 4.1(a) to 4.1(d) has arisen. 4.3 If sub-clause 4.2 applies, the Compensation Committee can decide that the relevant STIP award or part of the STIP award will be cancelled or should not have been paid and must be repaid by the Executive to compensate the Company for any overpayment. 4.4 Subject to sub-clause 4.5 the Executive will, if required to do so by the Compensation Committee, repay to the Company or to another Group Company as notified by the Company the amount of cash that the Compensation Committee determines is required to compensate the Company for any overpayment. 19\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n4.5 If the Executive was subject to tax, social security contributions or other levies (Taxes) on payment of the STIP award, and in the Compensation Committee\\'s reasonable opinion he will not get a credit or repayment of some or all of the Taxes, the Compensation Committee will reduce the amount of cash that the Executive can be required to transfer under sub-clause 4.4 by the amount that reflects the Taxes in respect of which credit or repayment is unavailable. 4.6 The Compensation Committee will act reasonably in using its authority under sub-clauses 4.1to 4.5of this Schedule 2 5 ONE-TIME AWARDS\\n\\n5.1 The Executive will, subject to the terms of this Schedule 2, be eligible to receive the following one-time awards in compensation for the short term and long-term incentive awards he will cease to be entitled to on cessation of his previous directorship of and employment with J Sainsbury plc or one of its subsidiaries (\"JS\"):\\n\\n(a) a cash award equivalent to the cash bonus he would have received from JS in respect of the 2019 financial year and payable in 2020 determined on the same basis as the compensation committee of JS awards a cash bonus to the CEO and Executive management team of JS;

Billie and Craig Talesman, having an office located at 1800 Frank Huff Road, Seminole Reservation, Okeechobee, FL 34974, hereinafter referred to as \"SIC\".\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nThe purpose and intent of this strategic alliance is to combine the resources and talents of, TKCI and SIC, in order to take advantage of every opportunity permitted by tribal sovereignty to create revenue streams in multiple areas in conjunction with operating partners that have existing marketing and customers in place, thereby limiting the capital requirements and risk. New marketing advantages based upon competitive pricing, cross marketing and new revenue streams from expansion into other industries will grow the business beyond anything previously imagined.

This listing             shall contain the price for each asset listed separately. MSL shall             notify IBM within 30 (thirty) days of the Effective Date if it does             not wish to receive all of the available tangible assets in             Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1B by notifying IBM in writing of the             types of equipment it does not wish to receive. IBM shall choose             which equipment MSL will receive based on MSL\\'s chosen equipment             type. The startup and investment expense defined in Attachment 4,             Section 3, shall be reduced by IBM\\'s net book value of the assets in             Part 1B for the equipment accepted by MSL plus [*] U.S. dollars             [*] for each non-capitalized printer. In any event, the physical             audit for all assets shall result in a new listing for the assets             contemplated hereunder which listing shall be substituted for the             Attachment 3: Asset List that is attached to this Agreement at the             Effective Date. The amount stated on the bill of sale of the assets             listed in Part 2 shall reflect the results of a physical audit and             obsolescence review. Such adjustments shall be subject to the             mutual agreement of the Parties.\\n\\n      c)    If by the Payment Date, MSL fails to pay IBM in full for the assets             listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 2 at the price specified in             b) above, IBM may offset the balance owed by MSL as provided in             Section 6.2(a) above, and without MSL\\'s further consent, until IBM             has recovered such balance.\\n\\n      d)    MSL acknowledges that IBM has not made any representations or             warranties with respect to the assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset             List, except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, including,             but not limited to the representation and warranty of title. All             assets delivered to MSL pursuant to this section shall be provided             on an \\'AS IS\\' basis.

The Employees who accept employment offers from             MSL and who have begun their employment with MSL (\"Transferred             Employees\") will be employed by MSL in accordance with the terms set             forth below. IBM will terminate all Employees, listed in Attachment             2, at the Effective Date of this Agreement and IBM will be             responsible for any and all employment related liabilities up to the             Effective Date, including, but not limited to, vacation and sick             time, workers compensation claims, variable compensation, and             severance.\\n\\n      c)    MSL agrees that all Transferred Employees will be continuously             employed by MSL for at least [*] after the Effective Date, except as             otherwise provided herein, and will receive a total compensation             package as identified in Attachment 2: Employee list and Benefits             Information. Furthermore, with respect to the Transferred Employees,             MSL shall grant, to the extent granted by IBM, credit for service             with IBM prior to the Effective Date for purposes of participation             and eligibility to participate under MSL\\'s employee benefit plans             and other policies and programs of MSL.\\n\\n      d)    Nothing in this Agreement shall operate in any way to limit or             prevent MSL from terminating any Transferred Employee at any time             for reasons of cause related to poor job performance or conditions             of employment.\\n\\n      e)    If MSL suffers a substantially adverse change in its business,             related to a reduction in IBM\\'s Products requirements, including             reductions of Products requirements due to migration to a             competitive supplier, for the [*] from the Effective Date of this             Agreement, MSL may terminate such number of Transferred Employees             as it deems necessary. However, IBM shall only reimburse MSL for             termination benefits paid to such Transferred Employees, which are             substantially similar to IBM\\'s then severance package, and             provided that all MSL subcontractors and other MSL non management             employees assigned to the US Work Center have been terminated             prior to or along with the termination of the Transferred             Employees.\\n\\nPage 12                                  Dated 05/05/98\\n\\n                                IBM Confidential\\n\\n      f)    IBM agrees that, for a period of [*] years from the Effective Date             of this Agreement, it will not in any way solicit for employment             any Transferred Employees without the prior written consent of MSL;             provided, however, that the foregoing will not restrict or prevent             IBM from a) employing any such person who contacts IBM on his or her             own initiative without any solicitation or encouragement from IBM             or b) by using general employment advertising or communications or             independent search firms, hiring any person who responds thereto,             provided that IBM does not direct or encourage such independent             search firms to solicit such Transferred Employees.\\n\\nSECTION 10.0 LEASE OF PREMISES\\n\\n      The Lease of Premises Agreement is a separate agreement governing the       lease of certain IBM buildings to MSL, the execution of which is a       condition precedent to the effectiveness of this Agreement.\\n\\nSECTION 11.0 MANUFACTURING, FULFILLMENT, AND INTEGRATION\\n\\n      Attachment 1 is the Statement of Work that outlines the manufacturing,       fulfillment, and Integration requirements and responsibilities of both       parties.\\n\\nSECTION 12.0 TRANSITION SERVICES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Supplement 1 to the Statement of Work identifies the Transition Services       that the Parties are to perform in accordance with the prices set forth       therein and starting on the Effective Date of the Agreement.

MSL       shall not use any proprietary processes for the assembly, subassembly and       final tests, and quality testing of the Products subject to this Agreement       unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing.\\n\\n13.2  Confidential Information and Advertising\\n\\nPage 13                                  Dated 05/05/98\\n\\n                                IBM Confidential\\n\\n      a)    IBM shall not receive confidential information from MSL under this             Agreement. However, if it becomes necessary for IBM to give certain             confidential information to MSL, it will be done so pursuant to the             Agreement for Exchange of Confidential Information (\"AECI\") Number             4998S60076.\\n\\n      b)    All information considered confidential by IBM will be marked             confidential by IBM prior to the exchange. If the confidential             information is to be disclosed orally, IBM will promptly provide MSL             with a written summary following the disclosure. In the event, the             information is not marked confidential, it shall not be deemed             confidential.\\n\\n      c)    Each time IBM wishes to disclose specific information to MSL, IBM             will issue a supplement to the above referenced AECI. All requests             to disclose confidential information must be approved by the             Relationship Managers. During the term of this Agreement and upon             the request of IBM, MSL shall return all confidential information             immediately.\\n\\n      d)    Neither Party shall disclose the terms of this Agreement to any             third Party, including debt or financing institutions, without the             prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be             unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as required by law.

These             include but are not limited to AAS, EOSE, GEMS, IPRs, Q-Ship, MES             and others as defined by IBM. In conjunction with these IBM ordering             channels MSL will perform Order Desk responsibilities. MSL will             review all orders requesting delivery improvements, improving these             order to satisfy the customer required delivery dates given supply             continuity and available capacity. At [*] to IBM, MSL will accept             [*]. Deferments will be requested of MSL through the IBM ordering             systems mentioned above, or in writing from IBM. MSL will             reschedule the deferred orders to meet the requested ship dates.             In addition MSL will accept request to alter order content if Parts             and capacity are available. MSL will respond to all request to             improve, defer and/or alter orders in [*] Days. MSL agrees to             maintain the above mentioned IBM Customer Order backlogs keeping             these back logs up to date.

The cost             are the responsibility of MSL. The method of transportation shall be             suitable surface or air transport to the Delivery Point, Customer             location, or point of entry sufficient to meet IBM\\'s Delivery Date.             The Product Attachment(s) shall state the Delivery Points.\\n\\n      b)    MSL shall arrange shipment with IBM carriers that will deliver             product to the destination on the IBM Customer Order in time for the             product to arrive on the committed arrival date which is stated on             the Customer Order. MSL shall utilize IBM carriers for all outbound             shipments, unless prior written approval from IBM to do otherwise.             IBM\\'s approval will not be unreasonably withheld.

MSL will be             responsible for defining the process to be used on the Integration             line, for the code load and system test of units requiring this             work.\\n\\n      b)    MSL will be responsible for the implementation and execution of             these processes. MSL will be responsible for maintaining the             necessary technical support to implement these processes and             identify problems in the integration process. Process deficiencies             will be brought to the attention of the IBM Integration program             manager staff for resolution. Deficiencies realized due to customer             provided items will be resolved directly with the customer through             the MSL account coordinator or by the technical staff, whichever is             appropriate.\\n\\n      c)    MSL will own the entire manufacturing and delivery process and be             the sole interface with the customer (IBM and/or end user) through             the account coordinators.\\n\\n14.5  Inventory Management\\n\\n      a)    Provide a secure environment for the management and control of             consigned Products. This area should be fenced, with limited access             and within a reasonable distance from the manufacturing area and the             receiving docks.\\n\\n      b)    An automated inventory management system must be used to track             receipts, disposition and balance on hand at any point in time.             Information required by IBM personnel performing project management             activities for customers will be provided on an \\'as required\\' basis             and will be readily available to such personnel. This inventory must             be labeled (bar coded) and separated by customer.\\n\\n      c)    Physical inventory counts are to be performed as needed for all             consigned inventory, for each customer, counted at least every [*]             Days with a accuracy target of [*]. This target is based on the             delta between the actual inventory count and the inventory             management system. Discrepancies are to identified, root cause             analysis performed, results reported (quarterly) and corrective             actions initiated. MSL is responsible for the cost associated with             the replacement of IBM and/or IBM customer\\n\\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 26 of 39 sow0501.lwp\\n\\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\\n\\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\\n\\n            consigned Products which have been received by MSL and need to be             replaced as the result of theft or negligence.\\n\\n      d)    All consigned inventory is the responsibility of MSL until Delivery.\\n\\n14.6  Manufacturing\\n\\n      a)    The integration line should use a line control system that ties to             an automated ordering system that provides order accuracy, tracking,             disposition and history. The work environment should be kept             presentable and organized and available for customer tours.\\n\\n      b)    Incomplete shipments, with the customer approval, should use a             deviation process and be documented with the customer authorization.\\n\\n      c)    The manufacturing process must continue to use the line break in,             pilot and certification process currently in use unless mutually             agreed to in writing.\\n\\n14.7  On Site Repairs\\n\\n      a)    The consigned Product set may include both IBM and non-IBM Products,             new as well as used which may or may not be covered by a new product             warranty, IBM maintenance or another maintenance provider. In the             case of IBM logo Products, MSL will initiate repair of these             Products in the most cost effective and efficient manner. In the             case of repairs required to be performed by the third party             maintainers, MSL will provide a suitable work area for these repairs             and ensure that the necessary security requirements are met when             visited by non IBM personnel. When consigned Product defects are to             be returned to the manufacturer for either repair/replacement, MSL             will control this process.\\n\\n      b)    Out of box failures of RS Products will be replaced from inventory             or repaired as directed by IBM. These replacements are to be given             priority over new orders during times of product constraints.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n14.8  Packaging\\n\\n      Integrated machines may require unique packaging based on their       configuration and the individual customers requirement. MSL will design       these boxes in accordance with IBM design criteria to insure that they       provide maximum protection against in route damage. All shipping       containers must be labeled in accordance with the guidelines outlined in       the Section 16.0 Packaging and in addition to any unique labeling customer       requirements.\\n\\n14.9  Security\\n\\n      a)    Sufficient security must be provided for work in process items,             customer and MSL/IBM provided. In addition, secured spaces will be             required from time to time for individual customers depending on the             nature of the work. Currently there is a contractual requirement for             secured space to perform the US Postal Service, hard drive, code             load program.\\n\\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 27 of 39 sow0501.lwp\\n\\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\\n\\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\\n\\n      b)    All reasonable precautions must be exercised to prevent unauthorized             access, use, modification, tampering or theft of software and             hardware consigned to MSL for the execution of Integration. Also,             these precautions must prevent unauthorized access to a customer\\'s             remote system used in the performance of Integration.\\n\\n14.10 Scheduling\\n\\n      Product orders placed on MSL by IBM, in most cases, the CRAD (Customer       Required Arrival Date) will tie to the Integration roll out delivery date.       In those cases where there is a difference, MSL will validate the correct       delivery date with the IBM project manager. If an improvement or deferral       is required in the Product build schedule and based on Product       availability, MSL will schedule the Product build to insure arrival by the       required CRAD.\\n\\n14.11 Delivery\\n\\n      MSL will maintain [*] percent ([*]%) on time delivery, measured against       the CRAD date in the integration roll out schedule. Due to the nature of       the integration orders, there is no [*] option, unless agreed to prior to       shipment by the IBM project manager and/or the customer.\\n\\n14.12 Customer Satisfaction\\n\\n      Customer satisfaction is the responsibility of MSL. IBM will measure the       customer satisfaction via surveys. MSL commits to a customer satisfaction       target of [*]. This will be a reflection of MSLs on time deliveries,       flexibility in meeting the customers unplanned requirements, the quality       of the services performed and MSL\\'s relationship, in general with IBM\\'s       customers. The customer set will include the IBM Global Services project       managers and IBM\\'s customers.\\n\\n14.13 Integration Quality\\n\\n      The service being performed is to be of high quality and free from process       defects. The target objective will be [*]%, measured monthly. MSL will be       responsible for the repair and/or replacement of Parts and Products which       have been damaged during the performance of the Integration. MSL will be       responsible for cost incurred by IBM as a direct result of MSL\\'s failure       to follow the Integration procedures subject to the limitations contained       in Section 15.3 of the Base Agreement.\\n\\n14.14 Price\\n\\n      a)    IBM will establish a list of those items which are standard             components of the Integration process. IBM and MSL will agree upon             an execution time and a price, as stated in Section 7.2 b), for each             standard item. Integration requirements outside of these standard             items will be individually determined. Once these prices for these             standard items are established they will remain in effect during             the entire term of this Agreement.\\n\\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 28 of 39 sow0501.lwp\\n\\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\\n\\n      b)    MSL will be responsible to track items which are beyond the             individual Integration SOW being executed when performed at IBM\\'s             request and provide sufficient documentation to support the price             along with IBM\\'s authorization of the added cost. MSL will invoice             IBM weekly for these costs. In those cases when a specific request             becomes standard, or a change in effort is requested by a customer,             a revision to the Integration SOW will be made and the contracted             price between IBM and MSL will be updated.\\n\\n      c)    MSL will be responsible for any cost beyond the agreed to [*] if             these costs were within the control of MSL.\\n\\n14.15 Transportation\\n\\n      a)    Premium outbound transportation may be used when requested by a             customer. In these cases, MSL must provide sufficient documentation             of the customer approval, and to support the cost.\\n\\n      b)    If premium outbound transportation is necessary due to MSL\\'s             failure to ship on time, this cost is the responsibility of MSL             and IBM will invoice MSL for these costs.\\n\\n14.16 Integration SOW Completion\\n\\n      At the completion of an individual Integration SOW, a complete       reconciliation will be completed within 60 Days. This reconciliation will       be between MSL and the IBM project manager/customer and will include, but       not limited to, an inventory reconciliation, any outstanding cost and       disposition of all customer software and hardware in MSL\\'s possession.\\n\\n14.17 Equipment\\n\\n      IBM will identify the current equipment, owned by IBM, needed to perform       Integration and it will be made available to MSL at an agreed to price per       Attachment 3 of the Base Agreement. If, at any time, MSL chooses to       replace Integration support equipment and the associated programs, IBM\\'s       written concurrence will be required.\\n\\n14.18 Restrictions and Limitations\\n\\n      Nothing in this Agreement authorizes MSL to use any of IBM\\'s tangible,       real or intangible property for the performance of any services       contemplated hereunder on IBM Logo products or for Integration services of       non-IBM Logo products related to a customer for whom Integration is being       provided by IBM. In any event, MSL will ensure that the IBM customer       delivery schedules will not be impacted based on other performance       obligations it may have during the term of the Agreement.\\n\\n14.19 Measurements/Reports\\n\\n      a)    MSL will be required to provide IBM with monthly reports detailing             their performance in relation to these Integration.\\n\\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 29 of 39 sow0501.lwp\\n\\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\\n\\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\\n\\n            These monthly report should provide at a minimum:\\n\\n            i)    On time delivery\\n\\n            ii)   Quality\\n\\n            iii)  Inventory management\\n\\n      b)    The specific targets are covered in this document under their             appropriate sections.

Any such audit shall be paid for by IBM     (or MS, as applicable) unless material discrepancies are disclosed.     \"Material\" shall mean an underaccounting of installed MS Software Images     valued at more than [*]. If material discrepancies are disclosed, MSL     agrees to pay IBM or MS for the costs associated with the audit. Further,     MSL agrees to indemnify IBM and its subsidiaries for any additional costs     incurred by IBM as a result of any unauthorized copies or copies which were     not reported to IBM. In no event shall audits be made more frequently than     semiannually unless the immediately preceding audit disclosed a material     discrepancy.\\n\\n5.  EXPORT OR RE-EXPORT. MSL agrees that it will not export or re-export an MS     Software Image to any country to which such export is restricted by export     administration regulations, without prior written consent, if required, of     the Office of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, or     such other governmental entity as may have jurisdiction over such export.     Restricted countries currently include, but are not necessarily limited to,     Cuba, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and Syria. MSL warrants and     represents that neither the U.S.A. Bureau of Export Administration nor any     other federal agency has suspended, revoked or denied MSL\\'s export     privileges. MSL further agrees that it shall not export or re-export an MS     Software Image in violation of applicable laws or regulations to (i) any End     User who MSL knows will utilize an MS Software Image in the design,     development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or     (ii) any End User who has been prohibited from participating in U.S.A.     export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S.A. government.\\n\\n6.

A       revised Attachment 5 sets forth any additions or deletions to the listed       Loaned Items. MSL\\'s continued use of the Loaned Items or acceptance of       additional Loaned Items after its receipt of a revised Attachment 5 will       constitute its acceptance of such Attachment.\\n\\n      The loan of Loaned Items is made in conjunction with the IBM and MSL       Outsourcing Agreement dated _____________________ (\"Referenced       Agreement\") for the purpose of MSL fulfilling its responsibilities and       obligation as stated in the Reference Agreement.\\n\\nSECTION 2 TERM AND TERMINATION\\n\\n      Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the EPLA will be in effect for as long       as the Referenced Agreement is effective.\\n\\nSECTION 3 LOANED PERIOD\\n\\n      IBM will provide the Loaned Items to MSL on or about the Effective Date of       the Referenced Agreement. The Loan Period for each Loaned Item will extend       from the actual date IBM delivers the Loaned Items(s) to MSL, until the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      earliest of:\\n\\n      a)    the applicable return date specified in the Attachment or revised             return date specified in a revised Attachment;\\n\\n      b)    the date MSL acquires i) title to the Loaned Equipment or ii) a             continuing license to the Loaned Program, should such acquisition or             licensing be available to MSL under Section 12: or\\n\\n      c)    on the Referenced Agreement expiration date.\\n\\nSECTION 4 AUTHORIZED USE\\n\\n      IBM provides Loaned Items to MSL solely for use in accordance with the       terms of this Agreement and for the Purpose of the loan described either       in this Agreement or in the Referenced Agreement (Authorized Use). There       are no charges for Authorized Use of the Loaned Items. MSL may not use the       Loaned Items for any other purposes.\\n\\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 2 of 7\\n\\nSECTION 5 OWNERSHIP AND LICENSE\\n\\n      IBM or another party retains title to all Loaned Items. MSL may not       transfer Loaned Items to anyone else. For Loaned Programs which are not       subject to IBM\\'s or another supplier\\'s or publisher\\'s license agreement,       IBM grants MSL a license to use, store, modify and make sufficient copies       to support MSL\\'s Authorized Use under this Agreement. Such copies will be       deemed to be Loaned Items. For Loaned Programs which are subject to       another supplier\\'s or publisher\\'s license agreement, however, the terms       and conditions of that supplier or publisher are passed to MSL through       IBM. Such terms and conditions will be shipped with the Loaned Program.       For Loaned Programs which IBM licenses to others under an IBM license, the       terms of the applicable IBM license which are not inconsistent with this       Agreement apply. IBM will provide such terms to MSL upon request Any       authorized copies made by MSL will be deemed to be Loaned Items.\\n\\nSECTION 6 LICENSED INTERNAL CODE\\n\\n      If the Loaned Equipment contains Licensed Internal Code (Code), so       identified by IBM, IBM grants MSL a license only to execute such Code to       enable the Loaned Equipment to perform in accordance with IBM\\'s official       published specifications. MSL may not reverse assemble, reverse compile,       decode, translate, or make any other copies of the Code. MSL must return       the original copy of the Code to IBM at the conclusion of the Loan Period.\\n\\nSECTION 7 DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION\\n\\n      IBM will deliver the Loaned Items to 8501 IBM Drive, Charlotte, NC 28262.\\n\\n      MSL will:\\n\\n            1)    set-up all Loaned Equipment, and\\n\\n            2)    install all Loaned Programs\\n\\nSECTION 8 RISK OF LOSS OR DAMAGE\\n\\n      IBM relieves MSL of the risk of loss of, or damage to, all Loaned Items,       except for loss or damage resulting from MSL\\'s breach of this Agreement       including use other than Authorized Use.\\n\\nSECTION 9 SECURITY\\n\\n      MSL will provide, at no cost to IBM, adequate security to protect the       Loaned Items from theft, damage or misuse.\\n\\n      MSL will use reasonable care in the use of all Loaned Items. MSL will       provide an operating environment for the Loaned Items consistent with the       related user documentation.\\n\\n      MSL will keep the Loaned Items at the Installation Address specified in       the Attachment. MSL will not move the Loaned Items to another location       without IBM\\'s prior written approval.\\n\\nSECTION 10 SERVICE AND SUPPORT\\n\\n      During the time the Loaned Items are in MSL\\'s possession, MSL shall, at       its own expense:\\n\\n      a)    Develop and maintain the expertise to operate the Equipment             independent of IBM and ensure that the Equipment complies at all             times with all federal, state, and local governmental safety and             other requirement (including OSHA regulations). If MSL determines             that any of the Loaned Items received from IBM fails to comply with             any such requirements, MSL shall promptly notify IBM, and IBM shall\\n\\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 3 of 7\\n\\n            either replace the Loaned Item or instruct MSL to modify the Loaned             Item so that it compiles, at IBM\\'s expense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      b)    Service the Loaned Items and maintain them in good operating             condition at all times.\\n\\n      c)    Replace or repair all items lost, damaged or destroyed except to the             extent MSL proves to IBM that such loss, damage or destruction is             caused by circumstances beyond MSL\\'s control. All replacement of             Loaned Items Shall become IBM property and shall be Subject to all             the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\\n\\n      MSL will permit IBM personnel full, free and safe access to MSL\\'s       facilities, during normal business hours, after reasonable notice, for the       purpose of inspection and inventory as IBM deems necessary.\\n\\nSECTION 11 ALTERATIONS AND ATTACHMENTS\\n\\n      MSL may make an alteration to Loaned Equipment (e.g., a change in the       structure of the equipment) only upon IBM\\'s prior written approval. MSL       may make an attachment to Loaned Equipment (e.g., coupling a printer to a       loaned personal computer) without notice to IBM.\\n\\n      MSL will remove any alteration or attachment and restore Loaned Equipment       to its unaltered condition before its return to IBM or upon IBM\\'s notice       to MSL that the alteration or attachment creates a safety hazard or       renders maintenance of the Loaned Equipment impractical.\\n\\nSECTION 12 DISPOSITION OF LOANED ITEMS\\n\\n12.1  Return to IBM\\n\\n      MSL will return the Loaned Equipment to IBM at the end of the Loan Period,       except as may be provided for in this Section. MSL will return the Loaned       Equipment to IBM in the same condition as when delivered to MSL,       reasonable wear and tear excepted.\\n\\n      MSL will return the original and all copies of the Loaned Programs at the       end of the Loaned Period, except as may be provided in this Section.\\n\\n      MSL will permit IBM personnel access during IBM\\'s normal business hours to       allow IBM to remove the Loaned Items.\\n\\n12.2  Acquisition and Continued Licensing\\n\\n      IBM will determine the availability of Loaned Equipment for MSL\\'s       acquisition and Loaned Programs for MSL\\'s continued licensing beyond the       applicable Loan Period. MSL must inform IBM, prior to the end of the       applicable Loan Period, of MSL\\'s interest in the acquisition of specific       Loaned Equipment or the continued licensing of specific Loaned Programs.       IBM will then notify MSL in writing either;\\n\\n            1)    of the terms and conditions under which MSL may acquire such                   Loaned Equipment or continue to license such Loaned Programs,                   or\\n\\n            2)    that the Loaned Items are not available for acquisition or                   continued licensing.\\n\\n      Continued Licensing of Loaned Programs will be governed by the provisions       of the applicable IBM license agreement or another supplier\\'s or       publisher\\'s license agreement. IBM will identify to MSL the applicable       agreement which governs such licensing.\\n\\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 4 of 7\\n\\nSECTION 13 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\\n\\n      IBM PROVIDES LOANED ITEMS ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS. IBM MAKES NO WARRANTY,       EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ITEMS, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED       WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\\n\\nSECTION 14 PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS\\n\\n      If the operation of a Loaned Item becomes, or IBM believes is likely to       become, the subject of a claim that it infringes a patent or copyright in       the United States or Puerto Rico, MSL will permit IBM, at its option and       expense, either to secure the right for MSL to continue using the Loaned       Item or to replace or modify it so that it becomes noninfringing. However,       if neither of the foregoing alternatives is available on terms which are       reasonable in IBM\\'s judgment, MSL will return the Loaned Item upon IBM\\'s       written request.\\n\\n      IBM will have no obligation with respect to any such claim based upon       MSL\\'s modification of IBM equipment, programs or programming or their       combination, operation or use with any non-IBM apparatus, data or       programs.\\n\\n      IBM will not have any liability regarding patent or copyright infringement       for non-IBM Loaned Items.\\n\\n      This Section states IBM\\'s entire obligations to MSL regarding infringement       or the like.\\n\\nSECTION 15 LIMITATION OF REMEDIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      IBM\\'s entire liability and MSL\\'s exclusive remedy for actual damages from       cause whatsoever relating to the subject matter of this Agreement will be       limited to the amount of $25,000. This limitation will apply, except as       otherwise stated in this Section, regardless of the form of action,       whether in contract or in tort, including negligence. This limitation will       not apply to claims by MSL for bodily injury or damage to real property or       tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable.\\n\\n      In no event will IBM be liable for any lost profits, lost savings,       incidental damages, or other economic consequential damages, even if IBM       has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In addition, IBM will       not be liable for any damages claimed by IBM based on any third party       claim.\\n\\n      In no event will IBM be liable for any damages caused by MSL\\'s failure to       perform MSL\\'s responsibilities.\\n\\nSECTION 16 GENERAL\\n\\n      MSL may not assign this Agreement without IBM\\'s prior written consent. Any       attempted assignment without such consent is void.\\n\\n      Loaned Items are to be installed only in the United States or Puerto Rico.\\n\\n      IBM will pay destination charges, both from and to IBM-designated       locations, for each Loaned Item shipped in accordance with IBM\\'s then       current shipping practice. MSL will pay any rigging charges. MSL will       furnish all labor for unpacking and packing except as IBM otherwise       specifies or when performed at an IBM-designated location.\\n\\n      IBM may provide services described in this Agreement by using IBM-selected       independent contractors.\\n\\n      Neither party is responsible for failure to fulfill its obligations under       this Agreement due to causes beyond its control.\\n\\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 5 of 7\\n\\n      Neither party may bring an action, regardless of form, arising out of this       Agreement more than [*] years after the cause of action arose.\\n\\n      In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement, the       provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, extend beyond the       expiration or termination of this Agreement shall remain in effect beyond       such expiration or termination until fulfilled.\\n\\n      If there is a conflict between this Agreement and an Attachment, the terms       and conditions of the Attachment will prevail.

In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party or any other indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof   26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nother than reasonable costs of investigation, unless (i) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations or circumstances.\\n\\n(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than due to the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities to which any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total Remarketing Fee received by the Remarketing Agents, as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.   27\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agents on the other and the parties\\' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities remarketed by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Remarketed Securities and not joint.\\n\\n(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Act. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.\\n\\n7. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agents. A Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any or all of the Remarketing Agents, by giving five (5) Business Days\\' prior written notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the Remarketing Agents; provided that no such resignation nor any removal of all the Remarketing Agents shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor to the Remarketing Agents, and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a   28\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nletter substantially in the form of Annex III hereof with the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agents pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement.\\n\\n8. New Remarketing Agents. The Company may appoint any institution or institutions as new Remarketing Agent(s) hereunder (each a \"New Remarketing Agent\") in respect of the Remarketing in which event, upon the confirmation by such institution through a letter to the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent confirming acceptance of such nomination by the New Remarketing Agent substantially in the form of Annex III hereof, such New Remarketing Agent shall become a party hereto, unless otherwise provided for herein, with all the authority, rights, powers, duties and obligations as if originally named as Remarketing Agent hereunder. The Company will notify the Remarketing Agent(s) appointed in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent of a change in the identity of other Remarketing Agents appointed or who have resigned in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities generally as soon as reasonably practicable.\\n\\n9. Offering Restrictions. Each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree that it has not remarketed or delivered and it will not remarket or deliver, any of the Remarketed Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that are reasonably designed to result in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations thereof. In particular, each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree as set forth in Annex V to this Remarketing Agreement.\\n\\n10. Dealing in the Remarketed Securities. Each Remarketing Agent, when acting hereunder, or when acting in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold or deal in any of the Remarketed Securities. The Remarketing Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketed Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agents, in their individual capacities, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder.\\n\\n11. Termination of Remarketing Agreement. This Remarketing Agreement shall terminate (i) in the event of a Remarketing that is not a Successful Remarketing or (ii) as to any Remarketing Agent who resigns or is removed, on the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 7. In addition, the   29\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nobligations of the Remarketing Agents may be terminated by them by notice given to the Company prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time on the Remarketing Settlement Date if, prior to that time, any of the applicable conditions precedent to the obligations of the Remarketing Agents described in Section 5 hereof shall have failed to occur.\\n\\n12. Survival. Notwithstanding any such termination set forth in Section 11 hereof, the obligations set forth in Section 4 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under said Section 4 shall have been paid in full. In addition, the former Remarketing Agents shall be entitled to the rights and benefits under Section 6 of this Remarketing Agreement notwithstanding the replacement or resignation of the Remarketing Agents. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Remarketing Agents, as set forth in this Remarketing Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent or any controlling person of any Remarketing Agent, the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.\\n\\n13.
