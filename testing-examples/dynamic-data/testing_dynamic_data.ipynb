    "# Evaluating Q&A Systems with Dynamic Data\n",
    "[![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langsmith-cookbook/blob/main/testing-examples/dynamic-data/testing_dynamic_data.ipynb)\n",

    "In many real-world scenarios, the correct answer to a question may change over time. For instance, if you're building a Q&A system over a database or that connects to an API, the underlying data might be updated frequently. In such cases, you still want to measure the correctness of your system, but you'll want to do so in a way that accounts for these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following tutorial, we'll use the age-old software practice of indirection to address this issue. Rather than storing labels directly as values, our labels will be _references_ to look up the correct values. In this case, our labels will be queries that the custom evaluator can use to fetch the ground truth answer and compare it with the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a dataset of questions and corresponding code snippets to fetch the answers.\n",
    "2. Define your Q&A system.\n",
    "3. Run evaluation using LangSmith with a custom evaluator.\n",
    "4. Re-test the system over time.\n",
    "\n",
