    "# Q&A System Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating a question and answer systems can help you improve its system design as well as the prompt and model quality. We tend to improve what we can measure, so checking for accuracy is a top priority. One challenge for measuring accuracy is that the response are unstructured text. A Q&A system can generate lengthy responses, making traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE unreliable. For this scenario, using a well-labeled dataset and llm-assisted evaluators can help you grade your system's response quality. This complements human review and other measurements you might have already implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, we will use LangSmith to check the correctness of a Q&A system against an example dataset. The main steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a dataset of questions and answers.\n",
    "2. Define your question and answering system.\n",
    "3. Run evaluation using LangSmith.\n",
    "4. Iterate to improve the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test run will be saved in a project along with all its feedback and links to every evaluator run.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/test_project.png\" alt=\"test project\" style=\"width:75%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note 1:** This walkthrough tests the end-to-end behavior of the system. Separately evaluating each component of system is still important! Many components, such as the retrievers, can be tested separately using standard retrieval metrics to complement this full integration test.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note 2:** If your knowledge base is changing, make sure your answers are still correct! You can avoid this through some combination of independent testing of chain components, freezing the knowledge source used during testing, and regularly updating your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses OpenAI for the model, ChromaDB to store documents, and LangChain to compose the chain. To make sure the tracing and evals are set up for [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com), please configure your API Key appropriately."

In this tutorial, you used LangSmith to detect issues in a RAG pipeline and make some prompt tweaks to improve the chain's performance. You have also learned about evaluator feedback and how to use it in your LLM app development process. This is a great start to improving the consistency of your LLM applications.\n",
