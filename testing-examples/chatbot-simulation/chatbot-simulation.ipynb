    "# Chat Bot Benchmarking using Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a chat bot, such as a customer support assistant, it can be hard to properly evalute your bot's performance. It's time-consuming to have to manually interact with it intensively for each code change.\n",

    "One way to make the evaluation process easier and more reproducible is to simulate a user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using LangSmith and LangGraph, it's easy to set this up.\n",
