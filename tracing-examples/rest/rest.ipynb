    "# Tracing via the REST API\n",
    "[![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langsmith-cookbook/blob/main/tracing-examples/rest/rest.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's likely that your production LLM application is written in a language other than Python or JavaScript. In this case, you can use the REST API to log runs and take advantage of LangSmith's tracing and monitoring functionality. The OpenAPI spec for posting runs can be found [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/blob/main/openapi/openapi.yaml).\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith tracing is built on \"runs\", which are analogous to traces and spans in OpenTelemetry. The basics of logging a run to LangSmith looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit a POST request to \"https://api.smith.langchain.com/runs\"\n",
    "- JSON body of the request must have a name, run_type, inputs, and any other desired information.\n",
    "- An \"x-api-key\" header must be provided to authenticate, using a valid API key created in the LangSmith app\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following walkthrough, you will do the following:\n",
    "- Log a generic chain run to LangSmith via the REST API\n",
    "- Add additional tags, metadata, and other information to the run\n",
    "- Log LLM (chat and completion model) runs to calculate tokens and render chat messages\n",
    "- Log nested runs by setting the parent run id\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on, make sure to create an account in LangSmith, and create an API key. Once that is done, you may continue. There are no dependencies apart from Python for this tutorial."

    "## Logging a Run\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a minimal example of how to create a run using the REST API. Since each run represents the start and end of a function call (or other unit of work), we typically log the run in two calls:\n",
    "- First create the run by submitting a POST request at the beginning of the function call\n",
    "- Then update the run via a PATCH request at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures the runs appear in a timely manner, even for long-running operations.\n",
