    "# Tracing without LangChain\n",
    "[![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langsmith-cookbook/blob/main/tracing-examples/traceable/tracing_without_langchain.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith lets you instrument **any LLM application,** no LangChain required. This aids in debugging, evaluating, and monitoring your app, without needing to learn any particular framework's unique semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith instruments your apps through run traces. Each trace is made of 1 or more \"runs\" representing key event spans in your app. Each run is a structured log with a name, `run_type`, inputs / outputs, start/end times, as well as tags and other metadata. Runs within a trace are nested, forming a hierarchy referred to as a \"run tree.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, LangSmith offers two ways to help manage run trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `RunTree` object: manages run data and communicates with the LangSmith platform. The `create_child` method simplifies the creation and organization of child runs within the hierarchy.\n",
    "2. `@traceable` decorator: automates the process of instrumenting function calls, handling the RunTree lifecycle for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough guides you through creating a chat app and instrumenting it with the `@traceable` decorator. You will add tags and other metadata to your runs to help filter and organize the resulting traces. The chat app uses three 'chain' components to generate a text argument on a provided subject:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An argument generation function\n",
    "2. Critique function\n",
    "3. Refine function\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these functions will call an openai `llm` function, and the whole series of calls will itself be organized beneath a parent `argument_chain` function, generating a trace like this:\n",

    "Ready to build? Let's start!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first install the required packages. The app uses `openai`'s SDK, and our tracing will use the `langsmith` SDK.\n",

The function inputs, name, and other information is then streamed to LangSmith. If the function raises an error or if it returns a response, that information is also added to the tree, and updates are patched to LangSmith so you can detect and diagnose sources of errors. This is all done on a background thread to avoid blocking your app's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app below combines three runs with the \"chain\" `run_type`. Run types can be thought of as a special type of tags to help index and visualize the logged information. Each of our \"chain\" runs call an function typed as an \"llm\" run. These correspond LLM or chat model calls. We recommend you type most functions as `chain` runs, as these are the most general-purpose."
