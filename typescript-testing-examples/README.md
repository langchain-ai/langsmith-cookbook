# JavaScript Testing & Evaluation Examples

Incorporate LangSmith into your TS/JS testing and evaluation workflow:

- [Evaluating JS Chains in Python](./eval-in-python/): evaluate JS chains using custom python evalators, adapting methods from the "[Evaluating Existing Runs](../testing-examples/evaluate-existing-test-project/evaluate_runs.ipynb)" guide.
- [Logging Assertions as Feedback](./simple-test/): convert CI test assertions into LangSmith feedback, enhancing trace visibility with minimal modifications.
