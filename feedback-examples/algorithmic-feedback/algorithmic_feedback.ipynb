    "# Creating an Automated Feedback Pipeline with LangSmith\n",
    "[![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langsmith-cookbook/blob/main/feedback-examples/algorithmic-feedback/algorithmic_feedback.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Manually analyzing text processed by your language model is useful, but not scalable. Automated metrics offer a solution. By adding these metrics to your LangSmith projects, you can track advanced metrics on your LLM's performance and user inputs directly from the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "![model-based feedback monitoring charts](./img/feedback_charts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the metrics reveal issues, you can isolate problematic runs for debugging or fine-tuning. This tutorial shows you how to set up an automated feedback pipeline for your language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filter Runs**: First, identify the runs you want to evaluate. For details, refer to the [Run Filtering Documentation](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/tracing/faq/querying_traces).\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Define Feedback Logic**: Create a chain or function to calculate the feedback metrics.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Send Feedback to LangSmith**:\n",
    "    - Use the `client.create_feedback` method to send metrics.\n",
    "    - Alternatively, use `client.evaluate_run`, which both evaluates and logs metrics for you.\n",
    "  \n",
    "We'll be using LangSmith and the hub APIs, so make sure you have the necessary API keys."

It has been tested with early design partners and on internal workflows, and it has been found to help teams in various ways.\\n\\nYou can find more information about LangSmith on the official LangSmith documentation [here](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).
