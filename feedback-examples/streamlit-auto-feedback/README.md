## LangSmith Streamlit Chat UI Example

In this example, you will create a ChatGPT-like web app in Streamlit that supports streaming, custom instructions, app feedback, and more. The final app will look like the following:

[![Chat UI](img/chat_overview.png)](https://langsmith-chat-feedback.streamlit.app/)

In making this app, you will get to use:

- LangChain chains or runnables to handle prompt templating, LLM calls, and memory management
- LangSmith client to send user feedback and display trace links
- Streamlit runtime and UI components

In particular, you will save user feedback as simple üëç/üëé scores attributed to traced runs, then we will walk through how we can see it in the LangSmith UI. Feedback can benefit LLM applications by providing signal for few-shot examples, model fine-tuning, evaluations, personalized user experiences, and improved application observability. 

Now without further ado, let's get started!

## Prerequisites

To trace your runs and log feedback, you'll need to configure your environment to connect to [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/). To do so, define the following environment variables:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=streamlit-demo
```

We'll be using OpenAI, so configure up your API key for them as well:

```python
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-key>
```

Since we'll be installing some updated packages, we recommend using a virtual environment to run.

```bash
python -m virtualenv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the project requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you should be able to run the app!

## Running the example

Execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

It should spin up the chat app on your localhost. Feel free to chat, rate the runs, and view the linked traces using the appropriate buttons! Once you've traced some interactions and provided feedback, you can try navigating to the `streamlit-demo` project (or whichever `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT` environment variable you have configured for this application), to see all the traces for this project.

The aggregate feedback is displayed at the top of the screen, alongside the median and 99th percentile run latencies. In this case, 86% of the runs that received feedback were given a "thumbs up."

![Aggregate Feedback](img/average_feedback.png)

You can click one of the auto-populated filters to exclusively view runs that received a positive or negative score, or you can apply other filters based on latency, the number of tokens consumed, or other parameters. 

Below, you can see we've filtered to only see runs that were given a "thumbs up" by the user.

![Positive User Feedback](img/user_feedback_one.png)

Click one of the runs to see its full trace. This is useful for visualizing the data flow through the chain.

If you provided feedback to the selected run using one of the üëç/üëé buttons in the chat app, the "user feedback" will be visible in the "feedback" tab.

You can add the run as an example to a dataset by clicking "+ Add to Dataset".

Before saving, feel free to modify the example outputs. This way you can ensure the dataset contains the "ideal" ground truth. This is especially useful if you are filtering by "thumbs down" examples and want to save "corrections" in a dataset.

## Code Walkthrough

The app consists of a main script managed by the `streamlit` event loop. Below are some key code snippets of what you've run.

After importing the required modules, you initialize the streamlit session state with a trace link and run ID, and with a "langchain_messages" key, which is in itialized within the `StreamlitChatMessageHistory`.

```python
if "trace_link" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.trace_link = None
if "run_id" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.run_id = None
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    chat_memory=StreamlitChatMessageHistory(key="langchain_messages"),
    return_messages=True, # Used to use message formats with the chat model
    memory_key="chat_history",
)
```

Then you define the core logic of the chat model. This example lets you select between two equivalent chains: an LLMChain, and a chain built with LangChain's [expression language](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/expression_language/).

#### Option 1: Expression Language Chain

The chain built using the LangChain Expression Language can be found in [expression_chain.py](expression_chain.py). It looks like the following:

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    chat_memory=StreamlitChatMessageHistory(key="langchain_messages"),
    return_messages=True,
    memory_key="chat_history",
)
ingress = RunnableMap(
    {
        "input": lambda x: x["input"],
        "chat_history": lambda x: memory.load_memory_variables(x)["chat_history"],
        "time": lambda _: str(datetime.now()),
    }
)
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a funky parrot pal. You are not an AI. You are a parrot."
            " You love poetry, reading, funk music, friendship, and squawking!"
            " It's currently {time}.",
        ),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="chat_history"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7)
chain = ingress | prompt | llm
```

The expression language lets you compose different `Runnable` objects in a transparent way and provides sync/async, batch, and streaming methods that work end-to-end by default.

#### Optional 2: LLMChain

The second option is to use LangChain's core workhorse, the [LLMChain](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.llm.LLMChain.html#langchain.chains.llm.LLMChain).
The chain is defined in [vanilla_chain.py](vanilla_chain.py) and looks like the following code block:

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True, memory_key="chat_history")
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a funky parrot pal. You are not an AI. You are a parrot."
            " You love poetry, reading, funk music, and friendship!"
            " It's currently {time}.",
        ),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="chat_history"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
).partial(time=lambda: str(datetime.now()))
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7)
chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm, memory=memory)
```

#### Streamlit State

Once you've defined the chat model, including it's conversational memory, we define another code block to manage the streamlit session state:

```python
def _get_openai_type(msg):
    if msg.type == "human":
        return "user"
    if msg.type == "ai":
        return "assistant"
    if msg.type == "chat":
        return msg.role
    return msg.type

for msg in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(_get_openai_type(msg)):
        st.markdown(msg.content)
    # Re-hydrate memory on app rerun
    memory.chat_memory.add_message(msg)

```

This does two things each time the streamlit event loop is triggered.
1. Re-renders the chat conversation in the UI 
2. Re-hydrates the memory so the chain will resume where you left off.

After this, we define a function for logging feedback to LangSmith. It's a simple wrapper around the client:

```python
# Imported above
from langsmith import Client

client = Client()

def send_feedback(run_id, score):
    client.create_feedback(run_id, "user_score", score=score)
```

This will be used in the `on_click` event for feedback buttons!

The logic for rendering the chat input and streaming the output to the app looks like this:

```python
if prompt := st.chat_input(placeholder="Ask me a question!"):
    st.chat_message("user").write(prompt)
    with st.chat_message("assistant", avatar="ü¶ú"):
        message_placeholder = st.empty()
        full_response = ""
        for chunk in chain.stream({"input": prompt}, config=runnable_config):
            full_response += chunk.content
            message_placeholder.markdown(full_response + "‚ñå")
        memory.save_context({"input": prompt}, {"output": full_response})
```

This renders a `chat_input` container, and when the user sends an input, it's converted to a "user" chat message. Then an "assistant" message is created, and tokens are streamed in by updating a full response and rendering it to markdown with a "cursor" icon to simulate typing.

Once the response completes, the values are saved to memory, which updates the streamlit message state so the conversation can be continued on the next loop.

Finally, you can create feedback for the response directly in the app using the following code:

```python
if st.session_state.get("run_id"):
    feedback = streamlit_feedback(
        feedback_type="thumbs",
        key=f"feedback_{st.session_state.run_id}",
    )
    if feedback:
        scores = {"üëç": 1, "üëé": 0}
        client.create_feedback(
            st.session_state.run_id, "user_score", score=scores[feedback["score"]]
        )
        st.session_state.feedback = {"feedback_id": str(feedback.id), "score": score}
```

To add additional comments or corrections via forms, we add the following code blocks:

```python
# Prompt for more information, if feedback was submitted
if st.session_state.get("feedback"):
    feedback = st.session_state.get("feedback")
    feedback_id = feedback["feedback_id"]
    score = feedback["score"]
    if score == 0:
        # Add text input with a correction box
        correction = st.text_input(
            label="What would the correct or preferred response have been?",
            key=f"correction_{feedback_id}",
        )
        if correction:
            st.session_state.feedback_update = {
                "correction": {"desired": correction},
                "feedback_id": feedback_id,
            }
    if score == 1:
        comment = st.text_input(
            label="Anything else you'd like to add about this response?",
            key=f"comment_{feedback_id}",
        )
        if comment:
            st.session_state.feedback_update = {
                "comment": comment,
                "feedback_id": feedback_id,
            }
# Update the feedback if additional information was provided
if st.session_state.get("feedback_update"):
    feedback_update = st.session_state.get("feedback_update")
    feedback_id = feedback_update.pop("feedback_id")
    client.update_feedback(feedback_id, **feedback_update)
    # Clear the comments
    _reset_feedback()
```

They use the streamlit session state to track the state of the feedback dialog and make sure the original feedback is still logged immediately whether or not the user wants to add additional commentary.

## Reusable Tactics

Below are some 'tactics' used in this example that you could reuse in other situations:

1. **Using the Run Collector:** One way to fetch the run ID is by using the `RunCollectorCallbackHandler`, which stores all run objects in a simple python list. The collected run IDs are used to associate logged feedback and for accessing the trace URLs.

2. **Logging feedback with LangSmith client:** The LangSmith client is used to create and update feedback for each run. A simple form is thumbs up/down, but it also supports other `value`'s, `comment`'s, `correction`'s, and other input. This way, users and annotators alike can share explicit feedback on a run.

3. **Accessing URLs from saved runs:** The client also retrieves URLs for saved runs. It allows users to inspect their interactions, providing a direct link to LangSmith traces.

4. **LangChain Expression Language:** This example optionally uses LangChain's [expression language](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/expression_language/) to create the chain and provide streaming support by default. It also gives more visibility in the resulting traces.
